\section{Discussion}
In this paper we have explored the world of indoor tracking, by looking into the main concepts and technologies of indoor positioning. 
We have looked at graph based techniques which utilizes low proximity technologies  such as: NFC, RFID, and Bluetooth. 
In this context we regard bluetooth as a low proximity technology, as it used in this way in the described techniques. 
Beside the low proximity tehcniques we have looked into Wi-Fi based technologies.
Last we explored some hybrid techniques where low proximity technologies are intertwined with Wi-Fi. 

The techniques looks promising, but all have advantages and drawbacks. 
The graph-based techniques have relative high precision, as the tags can be positioned such that they report the position where it is needed, but it requires relative high new infrastructure. 

Purely Wi-Fi based fingerprinting techniques can in most cases use existing infrastructure, but suffer from low precsion.
