\subsection{Offline Tracking}
\label{sub:offline}
With the information from the above subsections we are now able to produce a trajectory of a given object.
An offline trajectory contain data of where the object have already moved and is displayed in the following form:
\begin{align}
<readerID,objectID,tagID,t_{start},t_{end}>
\end{align}
First the output from output \ref{log:offline} is combined with the deployment graph.
We extract all entries with the fitting objectID, each entry is mapped to the deplayment graph.
Now we have a log with
