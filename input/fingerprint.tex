\section{Wi-Fi Based Indoor Tracking}
Wi-Fi is a widespread technology and is deployed at most offices, homes,and pulic buildings.
It is often used in indoor positioning systems \cite{mlws,5388848,832252,Bell2010,6068444}.
A technique which employs Wi-Fi is the fingerprinting technique
\cite{}. 
The technique is divided into two phases. 
An initial phases, called the offline phase, in which a \textit{radio
map} is created. 
The radio map is created by measuring the strengths of nearby Wi-Fi
spots. 

To use Wi-Fi for indoor positioning we use a so-called fingerprinting
technology \cite{6068444}
