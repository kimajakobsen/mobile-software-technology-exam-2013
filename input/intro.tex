\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} paper discusses different technologies for wireless indoor positioning and tracking. 
During the past decade, technologies like GPS have developed so much, that it is possible to track a person or an object within a few meters of is position, when it is outdoor. 
However, when looking at indoor positioning, there are a number of elements that makes it more difficult to track a person or an object.
The GPS signals that are used for outdoor positioning are too weak to be used indoor. 
Also the structure of buildings (walls, several levels, doors etc.) makes it further complicated.
So other methods for indoor tracking and positioning has to be investigated. 
These methods include Graph Based Indoor Tracing and WI-FI based services.
