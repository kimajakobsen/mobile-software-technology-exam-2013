\subsection{Maximum Speed}
\label{sec:speed}
When an object is outside the range of sensors it is said to be vacant.
When an object is in a vacant time interval its position can be narrowed down to the cell it is located in, see Figure \ref{ig:vacant}. 
Further it can be narrowed down based on the maximum speed of the object denoted $V_{max}\cdot\Delta t_1$ . 
The speed of an object type may vary, e.g. a human have a maximum recorded speed of 37.58 km/h~\cite{bolt}.
We view the range of the sensor $P_1$ as a circle with the sensors maximum range as radius, we denote this $R_1$, see Figure \ref{fig:speed1}.
Knowing the maximum speed of the object a circle can be drawn from the point where the object left the vicinity of the sensor, see $R_4$.
By drawing a circle with the radius $R_1 + R_4$, see $R_5$, is the area where the object is located. 
The next reading of a sensor of the object can be used to create a oval between the two sensor readings, see Figure \ref{fig:speed2}.
